**Gate::before**

- **If you want a "Super Admin" role to respond true to all permissions, without needing to assign all those permissions to a role, you can use Laravel's Gate::before() method. For example:**

- **In Laravel 11 this would go in the boot() method of AppServiceProvider: In Laravel 10 and below it would go in the boot() method of AuthServiceProvider.php:**

```
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;
// 
public function boot()
{
    // Implicitly grant "Super Admin" role all permissions
    // This works in the app by using gate-related functions like auth()->user->can() and @can()
    Gate::before(function ($user, $ability) {
        return $user->hasRole('Super Admin') ? true : null;
    });
}
```
